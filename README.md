# metaCRC

This repo was used to deposit the code to analyze the result in the project "colorectal cancer Primary - Metastasis tumor paired sequencing".

The local exome seq data and public NGS data were processed by the [pipeline](https://github.com/wenjie1991/metaCRC/blob/master/data_preprocess/Methods.md) first. After that, the processed data was [analyzed](https://github.com/wenjie1991/metaCRC/tree/master/data_process) and [visualized](https://github.com/wenjie1991/metaCRC/tree/master/plot) by the small pieces of scripts.
